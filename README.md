# A-Star-and-Weighted-A-Star-Algorithm
Python3 Codes for A-Star and Weighted A-Star Algorithm

# A* is a popular tool in pathfinding and graph traversal.
# A* star algorithm
* put w = 1 in line 14 of the code for simple A* algorithm. 

* The heuristic in this algorithm is consistent and admissible, providing the optimum solution.

# Weighted-A* algorithm
* put w = 1.2 (or any value greater than 1) in line 14 for Weighted-A* algorithm.

* The heuristic in this algorithm is not admissible, providing an upper bound for optimum solution.

* Noticeably Faster than RegularA*

# Both Algorithms are implemented for two games, (1) find a path in maze, (2) 8-puzzle.

* 8-puzzle: check lines 167-180 for 8-puzzle board setting

* Maze: check lines 153-155 for maze board setting
